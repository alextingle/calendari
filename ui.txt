TODO
----

-- HIGH --

x UI for Calendar subscribe.
x UI for Calendar publish.
o Prevent two instances from opening against the same database.

-- MIDDLE --

o Allow copying from Read-only events.
o UI for creating / modifying repeating events.
o Integrate with calsync
o Deal properly with multi-day (not all-day) events. They should not appear
  in subsequent months.
x Fix drag and drop  (all day events).
  Dragging day N to a new day should result in day N being on that day.
x Switch to "default" calendar when attempt to create new event in readonly cal
o Make a way to get out of the notes field, with just the keyboard.
o Make a way to get into Calendar List with just the keyboard.
o Signal when a month view cell is full. (Ellipsise the last slot?)
o Switch between calendar dialogues by clicking on cal entries in list.
o Auto refresh on start-up.
x Mouse-wheel scrolling.

-- LOW --

o Wrap time concepts into a separate library. E.g. allday goes noon-noon.
o Frame around main view?
o Automatically refresh when remote changes (inotify).
o Configurable timezone per event.
o Make Cut/Copy/Paste menu items inactive when nothing is selected/in clipboard.
o Make it impossible to remove the last calendar.
o Start empty database with Home + Work calendars.
o Go Today shouldn't change months unless it has to.
o Make it possible to change the source path of a calendar subscription.
o Support CALDESC. Notes field in calendar options + tooltip.
x Remember the position of the cal/event view separator.
o Re-entrant SQL transactions.
o Go to Today button.

-- FUTURE --

o Search
o Tooltips.
o week view
o day view
o List view
o Make drag item look like the event image.
o Remember positions of separator bars.
o Funky popup-day UI for setting times.
o Integrate with e-mail, invitations, VCALENDAR
o Database versioning / upgrade.
o Worry about all-day events in timezones beyond UTC+/-12
o Use gettext for i18n.
o List view - just list events in time order.
o UI for font size.
o Gnome Applet/ XFCE Panel plugin - date, clock?, quick launcher. Use colour?
o Event alarms / reminders.
o System tray notification icon - appear when event is due.
o Notification Manager integration - popup when event is due.
o Undo stack
o Print

BUGS
o Can't open hidden directories.
o Can't rename remote calendars, immediately after subscription.
o Need glade package
o Calsync autostart
o Crash on subscribe to bad filename.
o Calsync needs to create it's directories automatically if they don't exist.
